# HotPlateTimer

Android Timer Application based on a database of foods with known cooking time/temperatures. 

The user picks one or more food items from the database.

The app creates a single unified timer from the varied cooking times. 

The timer prompts the user when to begin cooking each food item in order that all items complete cooking at the same time.

Placed here for safekeeping, not sure if this is in a runnable state or not.
